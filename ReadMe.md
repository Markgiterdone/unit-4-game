Homework 04 – Crystal game notes

I made three versions of this homework.  

Version one had a bit of jQuery in it and it worked.

Version 2 was an improvement with more jQuery and made the code more efficient by not repeating some code

Version 3 was after my tutorial about how to change HTML using jQuery.

So, which one to upload?  I decided version 2.  I thought the game was “under-thought” and I did not like 
it that the crystals were essentially the same thing (might as well have had four anonymous buttons that 
call random values.  Instead, I wanted each crystal to be unique. So, in version two I changed the range 
of random numbers so that each crystal will fall into a pattern:  Diamond low value range, Emerald with 
next sized range, Ruby with next to highest range of numbers, and then Sapphire with the largest range of 
numbers.  AND I did not want those ranges to overlap.

So, that is the file that got uploaded.
